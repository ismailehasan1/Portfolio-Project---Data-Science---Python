- Credit Card Fraud Detection : Credit-card fraud is when someone uses our credit card or credit account to make a purchase we didn't authorize. Credit-card companies should take necessary actions to prevent fraudulent credit-card transactions. In this project, we develop an ML model to detect credit-card fraud.
