**- [Credit Card Fraud Detection :](https://github.com/ismailehasan1/Portfolio-Project---Data-Science---Python/blob/1aa5b7fc3b0ef9d4bff145d183f2075eaf0ada8b/Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb) ** Credit-card fraud is when someone uses our credit card or credit account to make a purchase we didn't authorize. Credit-card companies should take necessary actions to prevent fraudulent credit-card transactions. In this project, we develop an ML model to detect credit-card fraud.


- Predict Customer Churn with Python : Customer churn (also known as customer attrition) is the loss of clients or customers. It is most commonly expressed as the percentage of service subscribers who discontinue their subscriptions within a given time period. In this project, we will build a machine learning model to predict customer churn.
